# Increase-Yikes-MailChimp-API-Timeout

On some servers, the default 10-second timeout for the Yikes MailChimp Extended plugin may not be enough time. This plugin increases the timeout to 45 seconds. This doesn't mean that all requests to the API will take taht amount of time; rather, it means that 45 seconds will be the maximum amount of time that a request can take.
